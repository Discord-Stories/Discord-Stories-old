**It's still working in progress, not suggested to use for now, because:**
<br/><br/>
**Some testers has reported that this plugin affects the performance of their discord client, some optimizations should be done before 1.0** 
<br/>
**Also, this plugin haven't been posted on the BetterDiscordLibrary/ BetterDiscord Discord server #plugin-releases channel, which means it's not checked/ approved by BetterDiscord yet**
<br/>

This is Discord Stories system, just like how Instagram stories works.
