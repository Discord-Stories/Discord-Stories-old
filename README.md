<br/>

## Overhaul
Yes, definitely pain in the ass, but I must do it. Down below is all about the overhaul, what I'll do and change in the future.
<br/>
- Previously, the `plugin.js` file is a whole mess ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, because I didn't know much in webdev ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and I just used a whole bunch of code on changing the styles, which could be reduced by making a `theme.css` for the plugin.
  - I will use [React](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/wiki/Creating-Plugins#react), which might reduce some redundant code on placing the elements, also, I will try to use more classes for styles used in discord originally, so this plugin could fit into more themes.

<br/>
<br/>

- The stories column above the `Active Now` is kinda too small, which makes the size of the icon squeezes into a shape too small
- Forgot to add names under the icons in the concept arts & the code ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  - (TBD) Considering instead of putting the whole UI inside the plugin, I might make the UI as a independent website. Clients can login with `user id` and a `password` (kinda like an API key? Should be randomly generated and cannot be customized as it should only be used internally in API), and kinda embed it with `iframe`. So if I make big changes to the UI, the changes will on the webpage instead of the `plugin`, which also avoided the problem of *outdate plugins / auto updater*. (Not sure if this break ToS of BetterDiscord)
